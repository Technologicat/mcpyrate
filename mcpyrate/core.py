       (or `args`) it got vs. what it was expecting.

     - `TypeError` or `ValueError` as appropriate, if there is a problem in
       the macro arguments meant for the macro itself. (As opposed to macro
       arguments such as in the `let` demo, where `args` is just another
       place to send in an AST to be transformed.)

     - `MacroExpansionError`, or a custom descendant of it, if something else
       macro-related went wrong.

    Some operations represented by a macro may inject a call to a run-time part
    of that operation itself (e.g. the quasiquote system does this). For errors
    detected **at run time of the use site**:

     - Use whichever exception type you would in regular Python code that

        This is a hook for actual macro expanders. Macro libraries typically
        don't need to care about this; you'll want one of the `visit` methods
        instead.

        Transform the `target` node, replacing it with the expansion result
        of applying `macroname` on `tree`. Then postprocess locally, by
        `_visit_expansion`.

        `syntax` is the type of macro invocation detected by the actual macro
        expander, such as `expr` or `block`. What invocation types exist and
        what values of `syntax` represent them are defined by the actual macro
        expander. The value of `syntax` and its type can be anything; we don't
        even look at it, but just pass it on.

        `sourcecode` is a source code dump (or unparsed backconversion from AST)
        for error messages. It is a parameter, because the actual expander may
        edit the `target` node (e.g. to pop a block macro) before we get control.

        When calling the macro function, we pass the following named arguments:

          - `syntax`:     Our `syntax` argument, as-is.
          - `expander`:   The expander instance.
          - `invocation`: The `target` AST node as-is, for introspection if you
                          need to see not only the destructured `tree` and `args`,
                          but the macro invocation itself, without any processing.

                          Very rarely needed; if you need it, you'll know.

                          **CAUTION**: Not a copy, or at most a shallow copy.

                          **CAUTION**: The caller, i.e. the concrete expander's
                                       visit method that corresponds to the macro
                                       invocation `syntax` being processed,
                                       is responsible for providing a complete,
                                       unmodified `invocation`.

                                       So for example, if your concrete expander
                                       needs to pop a block macro, be sure to stash
                                       an appropriately prepared copy of the invocation
                                       (so that it looks like the original one)
                                       before you edit the original. This is used for
                                       debug purposes, so preserving the appearance
                                       of the original invocation is important.
