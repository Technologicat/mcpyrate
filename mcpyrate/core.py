       with how the macro was invoked, or with the AST layout of the `tree`
       (or `args`) it got vs. what it was expecting.

     - `TypeError` or `ValueError` as appropriate, if there is a problem in
       the macro arguments meant for the macro itself. (As opposed to macro
       arguments such as in the `let` demo, where `args` is just another
       place to send in an AST to be transformed.)

     - `MacroExpansionError`, or a custom descendant of it, if something else
       macro-related went wrong.

    Some operations represented by a macro may inject a call to a run-time part
    of that operation itself (e.g. the quasiquote system does this). For errors
    detected **at run time of the use site**:

     - Use whichever exception type you would in regular Python code that
       doesn't use macros. For example, a `TypeError`, `ValueError` or
       `RuntimeError` may be appropriate.

        This is a hook for actual macro expanders. Macro libraries typically
        don't need to care about this; you'll want one of the `visit` methods
        instead.

        Transform the `target` node, replacing it with the expansion result
        of applying `macroname` on `tree`. Then postprocess locally, by
        `_visit_expansion`.

        `syntax` is the type of macro invocation detected by the actual macro
        expander, such as `expr` or `block`. What invocation types exist and
        what values of `syntax` represent them are defined by the actual macro
        expander. The value of `syntax` and its type can be anything; we don't
        even look at it, but just pass it on.

        `sourcecode` is a source code dump (or unparsed backconversion from AST)
        for error messages. It is a parameter, because the actual expander may
        edit the `target` node (e.g. to pop a block macro) before we get control.

        When calling the macro function, we pass the following named arguments:

          - `syntax`:     Our `syntax` argument, as-is.
          - `expander`:   The expander instance.
          - `invocation`: The `target` AST node as-is, for introspection if you
                          need to see not only the destructured `tree` and `args`,
                          but the macro invocation itself, without any processing.

                          Very rarely needed; if you need it, you'll know.

                          **CAUTION**: not a copy, or at most a shallow copy.
