# Changelog

**3.1.0** (12 February 2021) - *Compiling on the high seas* edition:

**New**:

- The `mcpyrate` compiler (implementing [the import algorithm](doc/main.md#the-import-algorithm)) is now exposed in `mcpyrate.compiler` for run-time use.
  - You can just `expand`, or both expand and `compile` code, as needed.
  - It is now convenient to compile and run macro-enabled quoted code snippets (or source code) at run time, see the functions `mcpyrate.compiler.run` and `mcpyrate.compiler.create_module`.
    - This makes it easier to test macros that are best tested via the behavior of the run-time code they output. (It also makes macro-enabled Python into a poor man's staged language  [[1]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221024597_A_Gentle_Introduction_to_Multi-stage_Programming) [[2]](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/2869/what-are-staged-functions-conceptually).)
    - The system allows dynamically creating modules (for executing code snippets in) at run time, as well as running code in the namespace of an existing module.
      - These features combine, so you can let `run` automatically create a module the first time, and then re-use that module if you want.
      - You can also create a module with a specific dotted name in `sys.modules`. The multi-phase compiler itself uses this feature.
    - Source code input supports dialects, macros, and multi-phase compilation. The source code represents a module.
    - Quoted AST input supports macros and multi-phase compilation. No source transforms for this kind of input, because the input is already an AST. (Dialect AST transformers and postprocessors should work.) The top level of the quoted block (i.e. the body of a `with q as quoted:`) is seen by the compiler as the top level of a module.
    - While the code snippet is running, the module's `__file__` and `__name__` attributes are available, as usual.
    - For extracting results into the surrounding context, just assign them to variables inside the code snippet. The top level of the code snippet is the module's top level. You have that module object available in the surrounding context (where you call `run`), so you can access those variables as its attributes.
  - Full documentation is in docstrings for now, see [`mcpyrate.compiler`](mcpyrate/compiler.py). Usage examples can be found in [`mcpyrate.test.test_compiler`](mcpyrate/test/test_compiler.py).

- Add support for [PEP 582 - Python local packages directory](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0582/) in the `macropython` bootstrapper.

- The unparser now supports all three [top-level node types](https://greentreesnakes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nodes.html#top-level-nodes), and supports also a `list` of AST nodes (e.g. a statement suite in an AST) as input.

- The `StepExpansion` dialect now works in AST-only mode, too.
  - It will enable `DialectExpander` debug mode in the source transform step, if that runs. If the AST transform step is reached and debug mode is still off, it will now enable debug mode at that time. Only one copy of the unprocessed code is printed regardless.

- README: add instructions to configure Emacs syntax highlighting.

- Add `unpyrate.bunch.bunchify` to convert an existing mapping instance into a `Bunch`.


**Changed**:

- Nested quasiquotes now work properly.

  Unquoting now only occurs when quote level hits zero. Inner quotes and unquotes are detected, for tracking the quote level, but are then left in the output as-is.

  Note as-is means *"as unexpanded macro invocations"*. Because the quasiquote operators are just macros, and in macro-enabled Python, the tradition is that a function actually being a macro is a property of the *use site*, not of its definition site, it follows that there's no guarantee whether the quote operators are in the expander's bindings at any later time. Even if they are, there is no guarantee whether they still have the names they had at the time when the outermost quote expanded.

  What we have now is the result of taking the current design to its logical extreme. A better solution (for next-next-gen) may need a break from tradition, in that maybe a function being a macro should be a property of its definition site, not of its use site. Also, maybe the quasiquote operators should be considered core functionality, and not be renameable (like regular macros are).

  However, the current solution does give useful level separation that has real practical applications; see the dynamically generated module example in [`mcpyrate.test.test_compiler`](mcpyrate/test/test_compiler.py).

  This is not considered a breaking change, because the previous behavior of nested quasiquotes didn't make any sense, so nothing useful could be built on it.


**Fixed**:

- Fix https://github.com/INTI-CMNB/KiBot/issues/29, with thanks to @skorokithakis and @set-soft.
- Fix https://github.com/Technologicat/mcpyrate/issues/21, with thanks to @thirtythreeforty for reporting.
- Fix bug in `unastify`: drop the run-time part of `q`.
- Fix bug in `rename`: handle also module name in `ImportFrom` nodes.
- Fix `SourceLocationInfoValidator`.
- `macropython` now reports `mcpyrate` version separately from the version of the `macropython` script itself when run with the `-v` (`--version`) command-line option.

**3.0.1** (27 November 2020)

- Fix project metadata in `setup.py`.

**3.0.0** (27 November 2020) - *Arrr!* edition:

Initial release of **`mcpyrate`**, the advanced, third-generation macro expander for Python, after the pioneering [macropy](https://github.com/lihaoyi/macropy), and the compact, pythonic [mcpy](https://github.com/delapuente/mcpy). The emphasis is on correctness, feature-completeness for serious macro-enabled work, and simplicity, in that order.

We build on `mcpy` 2.0.0, but add a lot of new features.

**New**:

- **Agile development tools**.
  - [Multi-phase compilation](doc/main.md#multi-phase-compilation): Use macros also in the same module where they are defined.
  - Universal bootstrapper: `macropython`. Import and use macros in your main program.
  - Interactive console: `macropython -i`. Import, define and use macros in a console session.
    - Embeddable Ã  la `code.InteractiveConsole`. See `mcpyrate.repl.console.MacroConsole`.
  - IPython extension `mcpyrate.repl.iconsole`. Import, define and use macros in an IPython session.
  - See [full documentation of the REPL system](doc/repl.md).

- **Testing and debugging**.
  - Statement coverage is correctly reported by tools such as [`Coverage.py`](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/).
  - Macro expansion errors are reported at macro expansion time, with use site traceback.
  - Debug output **with a step-by-step expansion breakdown**. See macro [`mcpyrate.debug.step_expansion`](mcpyrate/debug.py).
    - Has both expr and block modes. Use `step_expansion[...]` or `with step_expansion` as appropriate.
    - The output is **syntax-highlighted**, and **line-numbered** based on `lineno` fields from the AST.
      - Also names of macros currently bound in the expander are highlighted by `step_expansion`.
      - Line numbers are taken from *statement* AST nodes.
    - The invisible nodes `ast.Module` and `ast.Expr` are shown, since especially `ast.Expr` is a common trap for the unwary.
    - To step the expansion of a run-time AST value, see the macro [`mcpyrate.metatools.stepr`](mcpyrate/metatools.py).
  - Manual expand-once. See `expander.visit_once`; get the `expander` as a named argument of your macro. See also the `expand1s` and `expand1r` macros in [`mcpyrate.metatools`](mcpyrate/metatools.py).

- **Lightning speed**.
  - Bytecode caches (`.pyc`) are created and kept up-to-date. Saves macro expansion cost at startup for unchanged modules. Makes `mcpyrate` fast [on average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortized_analysis).

    Beside a `.py` source file itself, we look at any macro definition files
    it imports macros from, recursively, in a `make`-like fashion.

    The mtime is the latest of those of the source file and its macro-dependencies,
    considered recursively, so that if any macro definition anywhere in the
    macro-dependency tree of a source file is changed, Python will treat that
    source file as "changed", thus re-expanding and recompiling it (hence,
    updating the corresponding `.pyc`).
  - **CAUTION**: [PEP 552 - Deterministic pycs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0552/) is not supported; we support only the default *mtime* invalidation mode, at least for now.

- **Quasiquotes**, with advanced features.
  - Hygienically interpolate both regular values **and macro names**.
  - Delayed macro expansion inside quasiquoted code. User-controllable.
  - Inverse quasiquote operator. See function [`mcpyrate.quotes.unastify`](mcpyrate/quotes.py).
    - Convert a quasiquoted AST back into a direct AST, typically for further processing before re-quoting it.
      - Not an unquote; we have those too, but the purpose of unquotes is to interpolate values into quoted code. The inverse quasiquote, instead, undoes the quasiquote operation itself, after any unquotes have already been applied.
  - See [full documentation of the quasiquote system](doc/quasiquotes.md).

- **Macro arguments**.
  - Opt-in. Declare by using the [`@parametricmacro`](mcpyrate/expander.py) decorator on your macro function.
  - Use brackets to invoke, e.g. `macroname[arg0, ...][expr]`. If no args, just leave that part out, e.g. `macroname[expr]`.
  - The `macroname[arg0, ...]` syntax works in `expr`, `block` and `decorator` macro invocations in place of a bare `macroname`.
  - The named parameter `args` is a raw `list` of the macro argument ASTs. Empty if no args were sent, or if the macro function is not parametric.

- **Identifier (a.k.a. name) macros**.
  - Opt-in. Declare by using the [`@namemacro`](mcpyrate/expander.py) decorator on your macro function.
  - Can be used for creating magic variables that may only appear inside specific macro invocations.

- **Dialects, i.e. whole-module source and AST transforms**.
  - Think [Racket's](https://racket-lang.org/) `#lang`, but for Python.
  - Define languages that use Python's surface syntax, but change the semantics; or plug in a per-module transpiler that (at import time) compiles source code from some other programming language into macro-enabled Python. Also an AST [optimizer](http://compileroptimizations.com/) could be defined as a dialect. Dialects can be chained.
  - Sky's the limit, really. Until we get [`unpythonic`](https://github.com/Technologicat/unpythonic) ported to use `mcpyrate`, see [`pydialect`](https://github.com/Technologicat/pydialect) for old example dialects.
  - For debugging, `from mcpyrate.debug import dialects, StepExpansion`.
  - If writing a full-module AST transformer that splices the whole module into a template, see [`mcpyrate.splicing.splice_dialect`](mcpyrate/splicing.py).
  - See [full documentation of the dialect system](doc/dialects.md).

- **Conveniences**.
  - Relative macro-imports (for code in packages), e.g. `from .other import macros, kittify`.
  - The expander automatically fixes missing `ctx` attributes in the AST, so you don't need to care about those in your macros.
  - In most cases, the expander also fills in correct source location information automatically (for coverage reporting). If you're discarding nodes from the input, then you may have to be [slightly careful](doc/main.md#writing-macros) and use `ast.copy_location` appropriately.
  - Several block macros can be invoked in the same `with` (equivalent to nesting them, with leftmost outermost).
  - [AST visitor and transformer](mcpyrate/walkers.py) Ã  la `macropy`'s `Walker`, to easily context-manage state for subtrees, and collect items across the whole walk. [Full documentation](doc/walkers.md).
  - AST [markers](mcpyrate/markers.py) (pseudo-nodes) for communication in a set of co-operating macros (and with the expander).
  - [`gensym`](mcpyrate/utils.py) to create a fresh, unused lexical identifier.
  - [`unparse`](mcpyrate/unparser.py) to convert an AST to the corresponding source code, optionally with syntax highlighting (for terminal output).
  - [`dump`](mcpyrate/astdumper.py) to look at an AST representation directly, with (mostly) PEP8-compliant indentation, optionally with syntax highlighting (node types, field names, bare values).
