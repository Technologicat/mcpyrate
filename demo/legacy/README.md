# Legacy demos

This folder contains the original demos from `mcpy` 2.0.0. They are still valid for `mcpyrate` 3.0.0.

We provide two versions of these demos:

 - [`classic`](classic/): a straightforward port of the original demos.
 - [`with_quasiquotes`](with_quasiquotes/): using quasiquotes (added in `mcpyrate`) to define the macros.
