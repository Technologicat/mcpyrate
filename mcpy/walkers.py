class Walker(NodeTransformer, metaclass=ABCMeta):
    """Simple functional-stateful AST walker.

    The state is a `Bunch` that lives in the property `state`. You can mutate
    it imperatively, replace it, anything you want.

    The point of `Walker` is it's possible to functionally update the state for
    a given subtree only::

        self.withstate(subtree, **bindings)

    While in that subtree, the updated state is available as `state`. When the
    walker exits that subtree, the previous value of `state` is automatically
    restored.

    We support collecting things during walking as well, Ã  la MacroPy; see
    `collect()` and `collected`.

    To start walking, just `visit`. There's no separate `recurse`, `collect`,
    `recurse_collect`.

    Example::

        def kittify(mytree):
            class Kittifier(Walker):
                def process(self, tree):
                    if type(tree) is ast.Constant:
                        self.collect(tree.value)
                        tree.value = "meow!" if self.state.meows % 2 == 0 else "miaow!"
                        self.state.meows += 1  # *mutate* the state
                    self.generic_visit(tree)  # recurse
                    return tree
            k = Kittifier(meows=0)    # set the initial state here
            mytree = k.visit(mytree)  # it's basically an ast.NodeTransformer
            print(k.collected)        # collected values, in visited order
            return mytree

        (when syntactically admissible), or `None` to delete the subtree.

        To keep things explicit, it's the responsibility of this method to call
        `self.generic_visit(tree)` to recurse into the children of `tree` when
        that's desirable (i.e. almost always).

        To *not* recurse into children (cf. MacroPy's `stop()`), simply
        *don't* call `generic_visit` from this method in the desired branch.

        To recurse selectively, just `self.visit` the desired subtrees.
